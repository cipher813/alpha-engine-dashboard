"""
OBSERVATION_REGISTRY.yaml loader for the dashboard.

The registry is the SoT for in-flight observe-mode rollouts (sibling
axis to ARTIFACT_REGISTRY: freshness asks "does the artifact land?" /
observation asks "is the consumer plumbed to read it yet?"). It lives
in the private `alpha-engine-config` repo, which is gitignored from
the dashboard repo but co-located on the EC2 console instance via
`infrastructure/boot-pull.sh` (pulls `/home/ec2-user/alpha-engine-config`
on every boot).

This loader reads the YAML directly from disk — no Lambda or S3 hop
needed (unlike ARTIFACT_REGISTRY, which has a freshness-monitor Lambda
writing aggregated state to S3). The registry IS the data; the
dashboard renders it as-is.

Path resolution (in priority order):

  1. ``OBSERVATION_REGISTRY_PATH`` env var if set (test override).
  2. ``/home/ec2-user/alpha-engine-config/private-docs/OBSERVATION_REGISTRY.yaml``
     (the EC2 console path that ``boot-pull.sh`` populates).
  3. ``~/Development/alpha-engine-config/private-docs/OBSERVATION_REGISTRY.yaml``
     (local-dev path — sibling-directory layout under ``~/Development``).
  4. Sibling-relative: ``<dashboard-repo>/../alpha-engine-config/private-docs/OBSERVATION_REGISTRY.yaml``
     (catches non-default layouts where both repos are checked out as
     siblings under an arbitrary parent).

Returns ``None`` if no path resolves — caller renders a "registry not
found" panel rather than crashing the page.

Defaults block in the YAML merges into each entry (so
`verification_status: audit-found-needs-curation` survives without
per-row repetition); this loader applies the same merge.
